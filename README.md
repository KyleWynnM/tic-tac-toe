# TIC-TAC-TOE

Hello, I'm Kyle McFatter

Attached are two files along with other configuration files to perform the described task of writing three functions to check the game state of a 4x4 tic-tac-toe game.

I opted for TypeScript to showcase my abilities there and to get some practice with that language.

The file `src/tic-tac-toe.ts` contains the main code for this project.

Then I utilized Jest to make sure the code was tested properly through 11 different possible game states testing the result of every function.

That test file is `__tests__/TicTacToe.test.ts`.
